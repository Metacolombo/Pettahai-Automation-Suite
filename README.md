# Pettahai Automation Suite

The Pettahai Automation Suite is a Python-based application designed to automate the breakdown of complex objectives into manageable tasks, process them through various AI models, and generate structured outputs. This tool leverages the Anthropic API to orchestrate tasks and refine results, making it ideal for developers and teams looking to enhance productivity through automation.

## Features

- **Task Orchestration**: Breaks down complex objectives into sub-tasks and manages their execution.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes AI models from the Anthropic API to process and refine tasks.
- **Dynamic File Handling**: Automatically creates folders and files based on AI-generated outputs.
- **Rich UI Components**: Uses the Rich library to enhance CLI outputs with styled and structured panels.

## Prerequisites 


Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to the Anthropic API

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seja-menath-dev/Pettahai-Automation-Suite.git
cd pettahai-automation-suite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python pettahai-agant1.5.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to input your objectives. The script will handle the orchestration of tasks and provide you with detailed outputs.

## Configuration

Set up your API key in the script:

```python
client = Anthropic(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Anthropic API key.
